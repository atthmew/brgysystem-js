Introducing, Barangay System Web Application, a comprehensive solution for efficient barangay management. This web-based platform, developed using MVC architecture and primarily utilizing EJS, features a robust citizen records system with full CRUD capabilities, allowing for seamless management of resident data. Administrators can easily handle borrowing requests and maintain detailed borrower records, ensuring smooth transactions. The system also includes a blotter module, enabling the issuance and recording of complaints with ease. For certificate issuance, users can generate personalized documents in one click, instantly downloading DOCX files with the necessary citizen information. Additionally, the application supports CSV and Google Forms for bulk user additions. With powerful report generation features, administrators can quickly download detailed reports on borrowing, complaints, and certificate requests, streamlining barangay operations like never before.</p>

## üë®üèº‚Äçüíª Getting Started

### Requirements

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/) or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

#### Step 1: Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/idurar/idurar-erp-crm.git
```

```bash
cd idurar-erp-crm
```

#### Step 2: Create Your MongoDB Account and Database Cluster

- Create your own MongoDB account by visiting the MongoDB website and signing up for a new account.

- Create a new database or cluster by following the instructions provided in the MongoDB documentation. Remember to note
  down the "Connect to your application URI" for the database, as you will need it later. Also, make sure to change
  `<password>` with your own password

- add your current IP address to the MongoDB database's IP whitelist to allow connections (this is needed whenever your
  ip changes)

#### Step 3: Edit the Environment File

- Check a file named .env in the /backend directory.

  This file will store environment variables for the project to run.

#### Step 4: Update MongoDB URI and PORT NUMBER

In the .env file, find the line that reads:

`MONGODB_URL = 'your-mongodb-uri'`

`PORT = 'your-port-number'`

Replace "your-mongodb-uri" with the actual URI of your MongoDB database.

Replace "your-port-number" with the actual port number in your server.js.

#### Step 5: Install Backend Dependencies

In your terminal, navigate to the /backend directory

```bash
cd backend
```

the urn the following command to install the backend dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This command will install all the required packages specified in the package.json file.

### Optional Steps

##### Format of the CSV File (CSV Comma Delimited)

![Untitled](https://prod-files-secure.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/98978455-ff45-4dc9-a314-70f76fbddeaa/faaa08d0-16cb-45c0-bc7a-c4c87cb83cdc/Untitled.png)

##### Step 5.2 (Google API): Get the credentials.json for the googleapis

- **Enable the Google Sheets API:**
  - Visit the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
  - You might need to create a project if you don't have one already.
  - In the Cloud Console, navigate to the "APIs & Services" section and then "Enable APIs and Services."
  - Search for "Google Sheets API" and enable it.
- **Create Credentials:**
  - Go to the "IAM & Admin" section and then "Service Accounts."
  - Click "Create Service Account" and provide a name and description for your service account.
  - Click "Create" and then go to the "Keys" tab for the newly created service account.
  - Click "Add Key" and select "Create new key."
  - Choose the JSON format for the key and click "Create."
  - This will download a JSON file containing your client email and private key. Rename the file to `credentials.json`

##### Step 5.3 (Take user from Google Form): Create Google Form

Create a Google Form that will take these information (IN PARTICULAR ORDER):

- Full Name
- Address
- Age
- Phone Number
- Occupation
- Civil Status
- Birthday
- Mother's Full Name
- Mother's Age
- Mother's Occupation
- Father's Full Name
- Father's Age
- Father's Occupation

##### Step 5.4: Link to Spreadsheet

- After creating the Google Form, make sure to link the responses to the Spreadsheet
- After linking to Spreadsheet, get the id of the spreadsheet and then put it in the:
  `controller/admin_controller/userController.js` - `addManyUser -> spreadsheetId`

#### Step 6: Run Setup Script

While still in the /backend directory of the project, execute the following command to run the setup script:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This setup script may perform necessary database migrations or any other initialization tasks required for the project.

#### Step 7: Run the Backend Server

In the same terminal, run the following command to start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the backend server, and it will listen for incoming requests.

#### Step 8: Install Frontend Dependencies

Open a new terminal window , and run the following command to install the frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
```

```bash
npm install
```

#### Step 9: Run the Frontend Server

After installing the frontend dependencies, run the following command in the same terminal to start the frontend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start the frontend server, and you'll be able to access the website on localhost:3000 in your web
browser.

:exclamation:
:warning:` If you encounter an OpenSSL error while running the frontend server, follow these additional steps:`

Reason behind error: This is caused by the node.js V17 compatible issues with OpenSSL, see
[this](https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/40547) and [this](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/14532) issue on
GitHub.

Try one of these and error will be solved

- > upgrade to Node.js v20.

- > Enable legacy OpenSSL provider

Here is how you can enable legacy OpenSSL provider

- On Unix-like (Linux, macOS, Git bash, etc.)

```bash
export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

- On Windows command prompt:

```bash
set NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider
```

- On PowerShell:

```bash
$env:NODE_OPTIONS = "--openssl-legacy-provider"
```

Here is [reference](https://github.com/webpack/webpack/issues/14532#issuecomment-947012063) about enabling legacy
OpenSSL provider

After trying above solutions, run below command

```bash
npm run dev
```
